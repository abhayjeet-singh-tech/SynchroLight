# SynchroLight
SpectraKeys is an audio-reactive RGB controller for Lenovo keyboards. Built in Python with FFT frequency analysis and beat detection, it syncs four lighting zones to music in real time. I created it to blend audio processing with hardware control, adding clear comments and TODOs for future features like Windows loopback capture.
